<!-- Skill: Connection -->

Trump’s tariff pause last week eased market fears but left small businesses navigating uncertainty, with many facing higher import costs. Local shops, from grocers to artisans, are the backbone of our communities, employing neighbors and keeping dollars close. Shopping locally isn’t just a purchase—it’s a vote for resilience, ensuring these businesses thrive despite global trade swings.

Visit a nearby farmers’ market or small store this week—use [Local Harvest](https://www.localharvest.org) to find one. Pick up produce, a craft, or a coffee, and chat with the vendor about their work. Share a photo of your purchase online, tagging the business to spread the word. Your support builds a stronger local economy. What’s your shopping glow? Post it!
