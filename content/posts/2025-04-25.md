<!-- Glow: 1 action, 1 skill -->
<!-- Skill: Connection -->

Last week’s news—coral bleaching, rail strikes, AI bias—revealed challenges we face together, from ocean health to fair tech. Each action you took, whether cleaning a beach, carpooling, or speaking up in a webinar, wove a thread in our community’s web. Sharing these efforts isn’t just about bragging—it’s about inspiring others to join in, turning individual acts into a collective force that fights isolation and builds hope.

Pick one action from your week: a cleanup tip (e.g., sorting recyclables), a carpool moment (e.g., a great chat), or a webinar insight (e.g., a new idea). Post it on social media with a sentence about why it mattered to you. Tag a friend to pass it on, creating a chain of connection. Your story, however small, strengthens us all. What’s your community glow? Share it!
