# Lanturn Glow: Bounce Back, Build On

*Skill: Resilience (Tied to Flood Action)* -->

Hey there, glow-getter! Monday, we lit up those Midwest floods—rivers spilling, homes swamped—and asked you to check your flood prep or pitch in to relief. It's heavy stuff, right? Water's messy, unpredictable, and when it hits, it can feel like the ground's gone. But here's the thing: we're tougher than we think. Resilience isn't about dodging the rain—it's about standing back up when it soaks you. Let's weave that into our flood fight today.

Start with your own corner. Gutters clogged? Grab a ladder, scoop the muck—takes 30 minutes, saves a basement. Sump pump dusty? Test it; a quick run at [Home Depot's site](https://www.homedepot.com) shows how. Small stuff, sure, but it's armor against the next downpour. Feeling it? Donate that $10 or an hour to Red Cross—they're hauling blankets and hot meals to Des Moines right now. X says donations spiked 20% this weekend—your drop joins the bucket.

Now, the glow: when stress creeps in (ladder wobbles, news bums you out), pause. Name it—"I'm rattled"—then breathe deep, five times. Psych folks at the [APA](https://www.apa.org) say this cuts tension 25%. You're not fixing the world; you're steadying yours. That's resilience—bouncing back, bit by bit. Tried it? Tell us at [lanturnweekly.com/glow](https://lanturnweekly.com/glow)—your grit lights ours. Tomorrow, we'll shift gears—stay with us!
