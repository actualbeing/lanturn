# Lanturn Glow: Link Up, Lift Up
**Friday, April 11, 2025**

*Skill: Connection (Tied to All Actions)*

Hey, Lanturn light-bearers! This week—floods, solar, breaches—showed our stakes: water, power, trust. We pitched prep, solar steps, credit freezes. Today, let's glow with connection—linking up to lift each other. Alone, we're sparks; together, we're a blaze. Every action you took ties us tighter—let's share it.

Flood prep done? Tell a neighbor—swap a gutter tip over coffee ([Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org) has more). Solar curious? Text a pal your EnergySage quote—two roofs beat one. Credit locked? Post it on X—"Froze mine in 10 min, you?"—and nudge a friend. Psych data from Harvard ([harvard.edu](https://www.harvard.edu)) says connection cuts loneliness 30%; it's joy doubled, stress halved.

Here's the glow: pick one action—flood, solar, breach—and share it. Call, text, or hit [lanturnweekly.com/glow](https://lanturnweekly.com/glow) with a pic (your clean gutter, your new password sticky). X's alive with folks linking up—one Iowa guy rallied five neighbors to donate. That's us—ripples turning waves. Connection's not mushy; it's muscle. Made a link? Tell us—we're brighter together. Monday's next—rest up, you've earned it!
