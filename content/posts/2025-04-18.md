## Friday, April 18: Link Up, Lift All  
<!--*Word Count*: ~550  
*Skill*: Connection (Tied to All Actions)  -->

Hey, Lanturn light-bearers! This week—flu, fire, layoffs—showed what’s at stake: our health, safety, work. We pitched shots, alarms, skills. Today, let’s glow with connection—linking up to lift everyone. A shot protects your neighbor; a lead saves a friend. Alone, we’re flickers; together, we’re a blaze.  

Got your flu shot? Tell a pal—text “Hit CVS, you in?” ([CVS.com](https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/flu)). Alarms tested? Chat up your landlord—share [NFPA’s checklist](https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Staying-safe/Safety-equipment/Smoke-alarms). Upskilling? Post a [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) win on X—“Nailed Python basics!”—or ping a laid-off buddy with a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) lead. Harvard ([harvard.edu](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/happiness-stress-heart-disease/)) says connection slashes loneliness 30%—it’s joy shared, worry split. X’s alive with folks linking—one Chicago nurse rallied her block for shots. That’s us—ripples to waves.  

The glow: pick one action—flu, fire, job—and share it. Call someone about your shot, drop a pantry tip at [FeedingAmerica.org](https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank), or tweet a skill milestone. Hit lanturnweekly.com/glow with a story or pic—your alarm beep, your course badge. Connection’s not soft; it’s steel. Made a link? Tell us—we’re brighter together. Monday’s next—rest up, you’re glowing strong!
