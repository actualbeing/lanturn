<!-- Skill: Connection -->

The Canadian rail strike that halted 40% of freight trains last week left commuters scrambling and goods delayed, showing how deeply we rely on shared systems. When trains stop, roads clog, and isolation creeps in—yet carpooling can turn disruption into connection. By sharing a ride, you reduce traffic, save resources, and create moments to bond with others, turning a challenge into a chance for community.

Use [Poparide](https://www.poparide.com) to set up a carpool with a coworker or neighbor this week. On the drive, chat about a shared interest—a hobby, a goal, or even the strike’s impact—to spark a real conversation. Post a quick story about your ride online, like a funny moment or a new idea you discussed. Your shared journey inspires others to connect. How’s your carpool glowing? Share it!
