# Lanturn Glow: Plant Your Why
**Wednesday, April 9, 2025**  
*Word Count: ~500*  
*Skill: Purpose (Tied to Solar Action)*

Hey, Lanturn crew! Monday's solar surge—5% of our power from the sun—lit a spark: clean energy's closer than ever. We nudged you to peek at your roof or back a community solar gig. Today, let's root that in purpose—acting with a "why" that keeps us going. This isn't just about watts; it's about the air we'll breathe, the world we'll hand off. Let's make it personal.

Picture this: your roof with panels, cutting your bill and coal's chokehold. Possible? Hop on [EnergySage](https://www.energysage.com)—plug in your zip, get a free quote in 10 minutes. No roof or cash? Community solar's your play—$50 buys a slice of shared panels in states like California or New York (check [EnergySage's Community Solar](https://www.energysage.com/community-solar/)). X's buzzing with folks posting their installs—one guy in Texas shaved $80 off his bill last month. That's purpose you can touch: power up, pollute less.

Here's the glow: pick your "why." Maybe it's your kids breathing easier, or just sticking it to the fossil fuel grind. Write it down—scribble "For my air" on a sticky note, stick it where you'll see it. Studies from Harvard ([hbs.edu](https://www.hbs.edu)) say purpose boosts stick-to-it-ness 30%. That's your fuel—every step toward solar's a step toward something bigger. Planted your why? Snap it for us at [lanturnweekly.com/glow](https://lanturnweekly.com/glow)—we're growing this together!
