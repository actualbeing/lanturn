<!-- Glow: 1 action, 1 skill -->
<!-- Skill: Connection -->

Last week’s coral bleaching alert in the Caribbean, with 20% of Jamaica’s reefs lost, reminds us how fragile our oceans are. Pollution, especially plastics, worsens the damage, choking marine life and stressing corals already hit by heatwaves. Joining a cleanup isn’t just about removing trash—it’s about forging bonds with others who care about our planet’s future. Your effort, no matter how small, helps reefs recover and connects you to a global movement.

Find a local beach or river cleanup through [Ocean Cleanup](https://www.theoceancleanup.com) and spend a morning picking up debris with neighbors. Bring a friend, snap a photo of your haul, and share it online with a note about why reefs matter to you. This simple act ripples outward, inspiring others to act and strengthening our collective resolve to protect what we share. What’s your cleanup glow? Post it!
