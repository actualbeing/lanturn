<!-- Glow: 1 action, 1 skill -->
<!-- Skill: Connection -->

Last week’s events—Kashmir’s tragedy, tariff uncertainty, banking debates—showed challenges we face as a global community, from safety to economic fairness. Whether you joined a dialogue, shopped locally, or spoke up in a webinar, your actions wove threads of connection. Sharing these efforts amplifies their impact, inspiring others to act and creating a web of support that counters division and doubt.

Choose one action from your week: a dialogue insight (e.g., a safety tip), a local purchase (e.g., a market find), or a webinar idea (e.g., a banking reform). Post it online with a sentence about how it brought you closer to others—maybe a neighbor’s smile or a new contact. Tag a friend to keep the chain going. Your story strengthens our collective glow. What’s your web-building glow? Share it!
