# Lanturn Glow: Slow Down, Lock In

Hey, Lanturn fam! That retail data breach Monday—10 million cards swiped by a phishing click—hit close. We said freeze your credit, swap passwords. It's a jolt—trust's wobbly when your info's out there. Today, let's lean into mindfulness: slowing down to shore up, not spin out. This isn't about panic; it's about keeping our heads while we lock the doors.

Take 15 minutes: freeze your credit at [Equifax](https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/), [Experian](https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html), [TransUnion](https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze)—free, online, done. Next, passwords—"LanturnShines25!" beats "password123" (tips at [CISA.gov](https://www.cisa.gov)). X chatter says freezes spiked 40% post-breach—smart move, takes a sec to join. You're not just saving your wallet; you're stitching the web we all lean on.

Now, the glow: before you dive in, sit. Five minutes, eyes closed—breathe in for 4, out for 6. Feel your chair, not the what-ifs. [NIH](https://www.nih.gov) says this lifts calm 20%—your brain's a muscle, give it a breather. Mindful clicks beat frantic ones; you'll lock in stronger. Done it? Share your calm at [lanturnweekly.com/glow](https://lanturnweekly.com/glow)—your steady hand steadies us. Friday's up next—keep glowing!
