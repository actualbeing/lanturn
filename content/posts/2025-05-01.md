<!-- Glow: 1 action, 1 skill -->
<!-- Skill: Responsibility -->

Last week’s push to loosen UK banking rules raised alarms about consumer protections, reminding us how financial systems impact everyday lives. Post-2008 ring-fencing shielded families from risky investments, but now banks argue it limits growth. Joining a discussion on fair finance empowers you to hold these systems accountable, ensuring they serve households, not just profits. Your voice can shape policies that affect us all.

Sign up for a financial reform webinar at [Positive Money](https://positivemoney.org) and prepare one idea, like stronger consumer safeguards. Speak up during the session, and afterward, share a key takeaway online to spark dialogue. Reflect on why fair banking matters to your community—maybe it’s a neighbor’s mortgage or a local shop’s loan. Your input drives change. What’s your finance glow? Post it!
