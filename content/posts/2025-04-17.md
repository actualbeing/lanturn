## Thursday, April 17: Slow Down, Step Up  
<!--*Word Count*: ~475  
*Skill*: Mindfulness (Tied to Layoff Action)  -->

Hey, glow-getters! Monday’s tech layoffs—15,000 jobs gone—stung. We said upskill, share leads. It’s raw—losing work shakes your core. But mindfulness can steady us: slowing down to act, not spiral. This isn’t about ignoring the hurt; it’s about finding clarity to move forward. Let’s glow with it.  

Pick a skill—[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) has freebies like Python or data basics, 10 hours to start. Jobless friend? Scroll [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) or X for leads—pass one on, takes 5 minutes. X’s full of coders swapping tips—one Austin dev landed a gig via a retweet. You’re not just skilling up; you’re weaving a net we all lean on.  

Here’s the glow: before you dive in, sit. Five minutes, eyes closed—breathe in for 4, out for 6. Feel your feet, not the fears. NIH ([nih.gov](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation-and-mindfulness-what-you-need-to-know)) says this boosts calm 20%. Mindful steps—clicking a course, sharing a lead—hit harder than frantic ones. You’re planting seeds for what’s next. Started a course? Shared a tip? Post it at lanturnweekly.com/glow—your clarity lights us. Friday’s up—stay with us!
