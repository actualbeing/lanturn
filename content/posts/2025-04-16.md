## Wednesday, April 16: Root Your Safety  
<!--*Word Count*: ~500  
*Skill*: Purpose (Tied to Fire Action)  -->

Hey, Lanturn fam! That Ohio factory fire—smoke choking neighborhoods—reminded us safety’s no given. We said test your smoke alarms, drop off pantry goods. Today, let’s root that in purpose—acting with a “why” that fuels us. This isn’t just checking boxes; it’s building a world where we all breathe easier.  

Grab a screwdriver, test those alarms—twist, press, listen for the beep. Dead battery? Swap it ([NFPA.org](https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Staying-safe/Safety-equipment/Smoke-alarms) has a guide). Takes 10 minutes, saves lives—yours, your kids’, your neighbor’s. Got a local pantry? Drop off cans or pasta; [FeedingAmerica.org](https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank) lists spots near Akron taking donations. X shows Ohioans rallying—one church filled a truck with soup. That’s purpose: every alarm, every can, is a brick in our safety.  

The glow: write your “why.” Maybe it’s “No family left in the dark” or “I’ve got my block’s back.” Stick it on your fridge. Harvard ([hbs.edu](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/purpose-driven-companies)) says purpose boosts follow-through 30%. That’s your fire—every step’s a stand for something bigger. Tested an alarm? Dropped a can? Share it at lanturnweekly.com/glow—we’re building this together. More tomorrow—keep glowing!
