## Tuesday, April 15: Bounce Back, Stay Strong  
<!--*Word Count*: ~450  
*Skill*: Resilience (Tied to Flu Action)  -->

Hey, Lanturn crew! Monday’s flu spike hit hard—5 million cases, hospitals creaking. We said get your shot, wash up. It’s a lot—sick days, worried glances at kids’ coughs. But we’re built to bend, not break. Resilience is our muscle for this mess, keeping us steady when the world’s not. Let’s glow with it today.  

Still unvaccinated? Hit [CVS](https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/flu) or [Walgreens](https://www.walgreens.com/topic/pharmacy/seasonal-flu-shots.jsp)—walk-in, free with most insurance, 15 minutes. Hand-washing’s your shield—20 seconds, warm water, every time you’re home. X says shot clinics are popping up in Seattle—join the line. These aren’t just chores; they’re armor for you and yours.  

Here’s the glow: when flu fears creep in, pause. Name the worry—“I’m scared for Mom”—then act (book her shot). The APA ([apa.org](https://www.apa.org/topics/resilience)) says naming stress cuts it 25%. Try it: breathe deep, five counts in, five out. You’re not curing the flu, but you’re holding your ground. That’s resilience—small wins, big strength. Got your shot? Snap a selfie for lanturnweekly.com/glow—your grit’s our spark. Tomorrow’s next—stay lit!
