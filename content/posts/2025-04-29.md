<!-- Glow: 1 action, 1 skill -->
<!-- Skill: Connection -->

The Kashmir attack last week, claiming 26 lives, reminds us how violence disrupts communities, leaving fear and division in its wake. In Pulwama, vigils showed the power of coming together to mourn and heal. Hosting a dialogue in your own neighborhood can spark understanding, letting people voice concerns about safety and build trust. These conversations, however small, create ripples of peace that counter conflict’s chaos.

Find or organize a community dialogue through [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com)—set up a coffee shop meetup or virtual chat to discuss local safety issues, like neighborhood watch or emergency plans. Invite a diverse group, listen actively, and share one insight from the talk online with a note about why unity matters. Your effort weaves stronger community ties. What’s your peace glow? Post it!
