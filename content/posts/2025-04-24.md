<!-- Skill: Responsibility -->

Last week’s AI bias lawsuits in California exposed how flawed algorithms can exclude women and minorities, undermining fairness in hiring and beyond. These cases, rejecting 30% more diverse applicants, show why we must hold tech accountable. Joining an AI ethics discussion isn’t just about learning—it’s about taking responsibility to ensure systems serve everyone equitably. Your voice can push for transparency and justice in tools that shape our lives.

Sign up for an AI ethics webinar at [AI Now Institute](https://ainowinstitute.org) and prepare one idea for fair tech, like mandatory bias audits. During the session, share your thought confidently, and afterward, post a key takeaway online to spark discussion. Even a single comment can influence policies and inspire others to act. Take a moment to reflect on why equity matters to you. What’s your tech glow? Post it!
